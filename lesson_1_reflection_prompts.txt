How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    - we can get to know if there are any typo error and what changes we have made in 
    the new version

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    - if at certain point suppose something went wrong we could easily make a look back 
    to see where we had mistaken or we could get a knowledge of why this function was 
    introduced at early time

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    - when u personally create a commit u are pretty sure why u made a commit like 
    u have reached certain milestone but the cons for manual commit is that u have to 
    remember to commit after achieving certain milestone

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    -As at certain point if u make a change in one file would also affect another file,
    so for such situaions git allows multiple saving with a single commit(Ps:- Change in Html and Css)

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    -By git log you can get to know all the previous commits been made on the file and then,
    by using git diff you can get to know the changes been made between two commits(Ps:-Asteroids)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    -By git checkout you can keep a switch to all the files like they where at the time of commit
    So it makes pretty handy to find which bug was introduced in that commit

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    -to keep an eye on all different version that i have been created
